    <h6>Consider the Number of Passengers and Luggage</h6>
    <p>The number of passengers and the amount of luggage you need to carry are crucial factors in choosing a rental car. If you're traveling with a large group or have plenty of baggage, a larger vehicle like an SUV or minivan will provide the space and comfort you need. On the other hand, if you're traveling light or with just one other person, a compact or mid-size car may be more economical and easier to maneuver.</p>
    <h6>Think About the Terrain and Weather Conditions</h6>
    <p>Where youâ€™re going plays a significant role in your choice of rental car. If you're planning to drive in a mountainous region or during winter, a vehicle with all-wheel drive (AWD) or four-wheel drive (4WD) might be necessary for safety. For urban areas with smooth roads, a standard sedan or compact car should suffice. Additionally, consider the climate; air conditioning is essential in hot climates, while heated seats can be a nice touch in colder regions.</p>
